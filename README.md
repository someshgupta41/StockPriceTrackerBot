# StockPriceTrackerBot

A basic starter bot that fetches the opening, closing, low and high prices for a number of stocks. 

Developed using the Google dialogflow framework. 

The voice bot has later been integrated with the messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and Slack.


*It uses the dialogflow's v1 version of the API.
